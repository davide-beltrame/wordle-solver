        INSTRUCTIONS: This function should return your next guess. 
        Currently it picks a random word from wordlist and returns that.
        You will need to parse the output from Wordle:
        - If your guess contains that character in a different position, Wordle will return a '-' in that position.
        - If your guess does not contain thta character at all, Wordle will return a '+' in that position.
        - If you guesses the character placement correctly, Wordle will return the character. 

        You CANNOT just get the word from the Wordle class, obviously :)
